# Programming in the *tidyverse*

![](opening-image.png)


Load the packages for the day.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)
```

## Filtering using expressions

Consider a case in which you want to filter a dataset, but you don't know what this dataset looks like, nor how you might want to filter it.

```{r}
# make some data to filter
data = as_tibble(mtcars)
```

Prepare the filters.

```{r}
# prepare filters as a character vector
filters <- c("cyl > 6", "mpg > 14")

# convert the filters to expressions
filters <- parse_exprs(filters)

# apply the filtrs using
filter(data, !!!filters)
```
