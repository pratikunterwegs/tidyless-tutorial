# Reshaping data.tables

![](wip.png)


```{r}
library(data.table)
```

The equivalent chapter in the TRES Tidyverse Tutorial has some explanation of what 'tidy' data is, but we'll leave the semantics aside and get to the code.

## `data.table`: A `data.frame` extension

The `data.table` is a development of the `data.frame`, which is faster and better in all possible ways. It does have some catches, which we'll deal with later.

```{r}
# Make a data frame
data.frame(who = c("Pratik", "Theo", "Raph"), chapt = c("1, 4", "3", "2, 5"))

# Or an equivalent data.table
data.table(who = c("Pratik", "Theo", "Raph"), chapt = c("1, 4", "3", "2, 5"))
```

The difference between `data.table` and `data.frame` is:

1. data.tables are built to be fast, and are actually external pointers to the memory location of the data.
2. data.tables follow _copy on write_, which means they are copied only when they are saved to another variable.
3. This follows from, or leads to the fact that data.tables also follow _modify by reference_ which means that data.tables do not make a copy when making a new column, making them faster and more efficient.

As a rule of thumb, try to convert your tables to tibbles whenever you can, especially when the original table is *not* a data frame. For example, the principal component analysis function `prcomp` outputs a `matrix` of coordinates in principal component-space.

```{r}
# Perform a PCA on mtcars
pca_scores <- prcomp(mtcars)$x
head(pca_scores) # looks like a data frame or a tibble...
class(pca_scores) # but is actually a matrix

# Convert to tibble
as.data.table(pca_scores, keep.rownames = TRUE)
```

This is important because a `matrix` can contain only one type of values (e.g. only `numeric` or `character`), while `data.tables` (and `data.frame`) allow you to have columns of different types.

## The concept of tidy data

Say we have a dataset of several morphometrics measured on Darwin's finches in the Galapagos islands. Let's first get this dataset.

```{r}
# We first simulate random data
beak_lengths <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 0.1)
beak_widths <- rnorm(100, mean = 2, sd = 0.1)
body_weights <- rgamma(100, shape = 10, rate = 1)
islands <- rep(c("Isabela", "Santa Cruz"), each = 50)

# Assemble into a tibble
data <- data.table(
  id = 1:100,
  body_weight = body_weights,
  beak_length = beak_lengths,
  beak_width = beak_widths,
  island = islands
)

# Snapshot
data
```

This is converted to long format using `melt`.

```{r}
data <- melt(
  data,
  id.vars = c("id", "island")
)

data
```

A common example of wide-or-long dilemma is when dealing with *contingency tables*. This would be our case, for example, if we asked how many observations we have for each morphometric and each island. We use `table` (from base R) to get the answer.

```{r}
# Make a contingency table
ctg <- with(data, table(island, variable))
ctg
```

`as.data.table` converts wide to long automatically.

```{r}
# Contingency table is pivoted to the long-format automatically
as.data.table(ctg)
```

### Pivoting long to wide

Data can be 'cast' from wide to long. 
FYI: The analogy is from working with metals, which are melted, and then cast.

`data.table`'s `dcast` takes a `data.table` or `data.frame`, and a formula where the left hand side is made up of the id variables, while the right hand side is the measure variables. The value variable can be specified using `value.var`.

```{r}
dcast(data,
      id + island ~ variable, value.var = "value")
```

### Pivoting with aggregation

`data.table` `dcast` also allows aggregation when there is more than one value per combination of LHS and RHS. In fact, a list of aggregation functions can be specified. Here we pass a list containing `mean` and `sd` functions.

```{r}
dcast(data,
      island ~ variable, value.var = "value",
      fun.aggregate = list(mean, sd))
```

There are a few other reshaping operations from `tidyr` that are worth knowing.

### Handling missing values

Say we have some missing measurements in the column "value" of our finch dataset:

```{r}
# We replace 100 random observations by NAs
ii <- sample(nrow(data), 100)
data$value[ii] <- NA
data
```

Remove rows that have missing values using `na.omit`.

```{r}
na.omit(data, "value")
```

Else, we could replace the NAs with some user-defined value.

```{r}
setnafill(data, 
       cols = "value",
       type = "const", fill = -999)
```

Here we encounter `data.table`'s _modify in place_ functionality. Functions starting with `set*` modify the relevant columns in place. In the example above, the `value` column has had `NA`s replaced with `-999` *without being assigned* using the assignment operator.

We could also replace NAs with the most recent non-NA values.

```{r}
ii <- sample(nrow(data), 100)
data$value[ii] <- NA
data

# use locf
setnafill(data, 
       cols = "value",
       type = "locf")

# examine data
data
```

### Splitting and combining cells

The `tidyr` package offers tools to split and combine columns. This is a nice extension to the string manipulations we saw last week in the `stringr` tutorial.

Say we want to add the specific dates when we took measurements on our birds (we would normally do this using `dplyr` but for now we will stick to the old way):

```{r}
# Sample random dates for each observation
data$day <- sample(30, nrow(data), replace = TRUE)
data$month <- sample(12, nrow(data), replace = TRUE)
data$year <- sample(2019:2020, nrow(data), replace = TRUE)
data
```

We could combine the `day`, `month` and `year` columns into a single `date` column, with a dash as a separator, using `base::paste` or `base::sprintf`.

### Assignment in a data table {-}

Here is a first example of assigning a column in a `data.table`.
We use the `:=` operator in combination with square brackets `[]` and a `,`.

A pseudo-code explanation is:

`DT[, new_column := function(old_column <OR> other)]`

```{r}
# using paste
data[, date := paste(day, month, year, sep = "-")]

# using sprintf
data[, data_sprintf := sprintf("%i-%i-%i", day, month, year)]
```

Splitting a column is a equally easy using the `data.table::tstrsplit` function, which transposes the results of `strsplit`.

```{r}
# using stringi::stri_split
data[, c("day_new", "month_new", "year_new") := tstrsplit(date, split = "-")]
```

Note the type conversion here.

### Expanding tables using combinations

Instead of getting rid of rows with NAs, we may want to add rows with NAs, for example, for combinations of parameters that we did not measure.

We could generate a tibble with all combinations of island, morphometric and year using `CJ`:

```{r}
CJ(
  island = c("Isabela", "Santa Cruz"),
  year = c("2019", "2020")
)
```

As you can see, we get all the combinations of the variables of interest, even those that are missing. But sometimes you might be interested in variables that are *nested* within each other and not *crossed*. For example, say we have measured birds at different locations within each island.

```{r}
# assign sites A and B to Isabella
# and C and D to Santa Cruz
data[, site := unlist(lapply(data$island, 
                             function(z) {
                               ifelse(z == "Isabela",
                                      sample(LETTERS[1:2]),
                                      sample(LETTERS[3:4]))
                               })
                      )]
```

Of course, if sites A and B are on Isabela, they cannot be on Santa Cruz, where we have sites C and D instead. We can figure out which combinations exist in the data using the `duplicated` function.

`duplicated` returns a `logical` vector, which can be used to filter the data.table.

```{r}
dt_new[!duplicated(dt_new[, .(island, site, year)]), # check for dups
       .(island, site, year)] # select column in the data.table
```

### Nesting or list columns

`data.table` supports nested list columns, where the contents of a cell are not atomic (integers, numerics, characters etc.), but more complex objects such as vectors or data.tables themselves.

## Extra: Dealing with factors

```{r}
library(forcats)
```

Categorical variables can be stored in R as character strings in `character` or `factor` objects. A `factor` looks like a `character`, but it actually is an `integer` vector, where each `integer` is mapped to a `character` label. With this respect it is sort of an enhanced version of `character`. For example,

```{r}
my_char_vec <- c("Pratik", "Theo", "Raph")
my_char_vec
```

is a `character` vector, recognizable to its double quotes, while

```{r}
my_fact_vec <- factor(my_char_vec) # as.factor would work too
my_fact_vec
```

is a `factor`, of which the *labels* are displayed. The *levels* of the factor are the unique values that appear in the vector. If I added an extra occurrence of my name:

```{r}
factor(c(my_char_vec, "Raph"))
```

we would still have the the same levels. Note that the levels are returned as a `character` vector in alphabetical order by the `levels` function:

```{r}
levels(my_fact_vec)
```

![](wip.png)

Why does it matter? Well, most operations on categorical variables can be performed on `character` of `factor` objects, so it does not matter so much which one you use for your own data. However, some functions in R require you to provide categorical variables in one specific format, and others may even implicitely convert your variables. In `ggplot2` for example, character vectors are converted into factors by default. So, it is always good to remember the differences and what type your variables are.

But this is a tidyverse tutorial, so I would like to introduce here the package `forcats`, which offers tools to manipulate factors. First of all, most tools from `stringr` *will work* on factors. The `forcats` functions expand the string manipulation toolbox with factor-specific utilities. Similar in philosophy to `stringr` where functions started with `str_`, in `forcats` most functions start with `fct_`.

I see two main ways `forcats` can come handy in the kind of data most people deal with: playing with the order of the levels of a factor and playing with the levels themselves. We will show here a few examples, but the full breadth of factor manipulations can be found online or in the excellent `forcats` cheatsheet.

### Change the order of the levels

One example use-case where you would want to change the order of the levels of a factor is when plotting. Your categorical variable, for example, may not be plotted in the order you want. If we plot the distribution of each variable across islands, we get

```{r}
# Make the plotting code a function so we can re-use it without copying and pasting
my_plot <- function(data) {

  # We do not cover the ggplot functions in this chapter, this is just to
  # illustrate our use-case, wait until chapter 5!
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(data, aes(x = island, y = value, color = island)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
    facet_grid(variable ~ year, scales = "free") +
    theme_bw() +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("forestgreen", "goldenrod"))

}

my_plot(data)
# Remember that data are missing from Santa Cruz in 2020
```

Here, the islands (horizontal axis) and the variables (the facets) are displayed in alphabetical order. When making a figure you may want to customize these orders in such a way that your message is optimally conveyed by your figure, and this may involve playing with the order of levels.

Simply use `factor` with the `levels = (...)` argument to set the factor levels as required.

```{r}
data$island <- as.factor(data$island) # turn this column into a factor
data$island <- factor(data$island, levels = c("Santa Cruz", "Isabela"))
my_plot(data) # order of islands has changed!
```

Beware that reordering a factor *does not change* the order of the items within the vector, only the order of the *levels*. So, it does not introduce any mistmatch between the `island` column and the other columns! It only matters when the levels are called, for example, in a `ggplot`. As you can see:

```{r}
data$island[1:10]
factor(data$island, levels = c("Isabela", "Santa Cruz"))[1:10] # same thing, different levels
```

When converting a column to a factor, the levels are set _by default_ in the order in which they appear. The example below shows this in the ordering of the `beak_*` metrics, where the order is of appearance, and not alphabetical.

```{r}
data$variable <- as.factor(data$variable)
levels(data$variable)
levels(fct_inorder(data$variable))
```

or `fct_rev` to reverse the order of the levels:

```{r}
levels(data$island)
# now in reversed order
levels(factor(data$island, 
              levels = rev(levels(data$island)))) 
```

![](wip.png)

Other variants exist to do more complex reordering, all present in the forcats  [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), for example:
* `fct_infreq` to re-order according to the frequency of each level (how many observation on each island?)
* `fct_shift` to shift the order of all levels by a certain rank (in a circular way so that the last one becomes the first one or vice versa)
* `fct_shuffle` if you want your levels in random order
* `fct_reorder`, which reorders based on an associated variable (see `fct_reorder2` for even more complex relationship between the factor and the associated variable)

### Change the levels themselves

Changing the levels of a factor will change the labels in the actual vector. It is similar to performing a string substitution in `stringr`. One can change the levels of a factor using `fct_recode`:

```{r}
fct_recode(
  my_fact_vec,
  "Pratik Gupte" = "Pratik",
  "Theo Pannetier" = "Theo",
  "Raphael Scherrer" = "Raph"
)
```

or collapse factor levels together using `fct_collapse`:

```{r}
fct_collapse(my_fact_vec, EU = c("Theo", "Raph"), NonEU = "Pratik")
```

Again, we do not provide an exhaustive list of `forcats` functions here but the most usual ones, to give a glimpse of many things that one can do with factors. So, if you are dealing with factors, remember that `forcats` may have handy tools for you. Among others:
* `fct_anon` to "anonymize", i.e. replace the levels by random integers
* `fct_lump` to collapse levels together based on their frequency (e.g. the two most frequent levels together)

### Dropping levels

If you use factors in your tibble and get rid of one level, for any reason, the factor will usually remember the old levels, which may cause some problems when applying functions to your data.

```{r}
data <- data[data$island == "Santa Cruz",] # keep only one island
unique(data$island) # Isabela is gone from the labels
levels(data$island) # but not from the levels
```

Use `droplevels` (from base R) to make sure you get rid of levels that are not in your data anymore:

```{r}
data <- droplevels(data)
levels(data$island)
```

Fortunately, most functions within the tidyverse will not complain about missing levels, and will automatically get rid of those inexistant levels for you. But because factors are such common causes of bugs, keep this in mind!

Note that this is equivalent to doing:

```{r}
data$island <- fct_drop(data$island)
```

### Other things

Among other things you can use in `forcats`:
* `fct_count` to get the frequency of each level
* `fct_c` to combine factors together

### Take home message for forcats

Use this package to manipulate your factors. Do you need factors? Or are character vectors enough? That is your call, and may depend on the kind of analyses you want to do and what they require. We saw here that for plotting, having factors can allow you to do quite some tweaking of the display. If you encounter a situation where the order of encoding of your character vector starts to matter, then maybe converting into a factor would make your life easier. And if you do so, remember that lots of tools to perform all kinds of manipulation are available to you with both `stringr`and `forcats`.
