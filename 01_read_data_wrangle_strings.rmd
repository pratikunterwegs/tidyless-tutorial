# Reading files and string manipulation

Instead of using `stringr`, we will use the `stringi` package on which it is based, and read files using the `data.table` package. 
We will use `paste` and `sprintf` from base `R` to handle string interpolation.

![](wip.png)


Load the packages for the day.

```{r load_packages_01}
library(data.table)
library(stringi)
```

## Data import and export with `data.table`

`data.table` provides the `fread` and `fwrite` functions to read and write text data. These are currently the fastest text file read/write functions for data science available.

### Reading data

```{r}
# read the file in
some_example <- fread("data/phylacine_traits.csv")

head(some_example)
```

The `fread` function easily handles files where the separator is a semicolon `;`, and the decimal is a comma `,`.

Do this by specifying the `sep` and `dec` arguments.

```{r eval = FALSE}
fread(input = "", sep = ";", dec = ",")
```

In fact, `fread` will intelligently attempt to guess when the decimal is a semicolon, but it's best to specify this explicitly.

Further, `fread` can read in only a specific number of rows if required using the `nrows` argument, while `skip` allows the first _N_ rows to be skipped.

By default, the column names are taken from the first row of the data, but they can be manually specified by passing a character vector to `col.names`.

There are other arguments to `fread`, but the defaults usually *just work*.

### Writing data

Data is written to file using the `fwrite` function.
`fwrite` is very flexible, and allows appending to an exisiting file using the `append` argument.
`fwrite` is not covered here.

### Reading and writing lines

Sometimes, there is text output generated in `R` which needs to be written to file, but is not in the form of a dataframe. 
A good example is model outputs. 
It is good practice to save model output as a text file, and add it to version control.
Similarly, it may be necessary to import such text, either for display to screen, or to extract data.

This can _also_ be done using the `fwrite` function.
It can also be done using `writeLines`.
The difference is that `fwrite` accepts a list of strings, while `writeLines` accepts a vector. Interconversion is easy.
Consider the model summary from a simple linear model.

```{r}
# get the model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
```

The model summary can be written to file. When writing lines to file, BE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNIX AND WINODWS line separators. Usually, this causes no trouble.

```{r}
# capture the model summary output
model_output <- capture.output(summary(model))

# save to file using writeLines
writeLines(text = model_output,
           con = "model_output.txt")

# save to file using fwrite
fwrite(x = list(model_output),
       file = "model_output_fwrite.txt")
```

This model output can be read back in for display, and each line of the model output is an element in a character vector. This is done using `readLines`.

Why not use `fread`? `fread` is designed to import text files as `data.tables`. So while it can read in the `model_output.txt` file (using the `sep = \n`), it will return either a `data.table` or `data.frame`.

```{r}
# read in the model output and display
model_output <- readLines("model_output.txt")

# use cat to show the model output as it would be on screen
cat(model_output, sep = "\n")
```

These few functions demonstrate the most common uses of `fread` and `fwrite`, but most other use cases for text data can be handled using different function arguments, including reading data off the web, unzipping compressed files before reading, and specifying the column types to control for type conversion errors.

### Excel files {-}

Finally, data is often shared or stored by well meaning people in the form of Microsoft Excel sheets. 
Indeed, Excel (especially when synced regularly to remote storage) is a good way of noting down observational data in the field. 
`data.table` allows importing from Excel files using `fread` and writing to Excel files using `fwrite`.

## String manipulation with `stringi`

The `stringi` package's default functionality is almost always more than sufficient for day-to-day needs. It it not entirely clear why `stringr` had to be built on top of it, since the functions are almost identical.

`stringi` functions begin with `stri_`.

### Putting strings together

Concatenate two strings with `stri_c`, and duplicate strings with `stri_dup`. Flatten a list or vector of strings using `stri_flatten`.

```{r string_joining_01, echo=TRUE}
# stri_c works like paste(), choose a separator
stri_c("this string", "this other string", sep = "_")

# stri_dup works like rep
stri_dup("this string", times = 3)

# stri_flatten works on lists and vectors
stri_flatten(str = as.list(letters), collapse = "_")
stri_flatten(str = letters, collapse = "-")
```

`stri_flatten` is especially useful when displaying the type of an object that returns a list when `class` is called on it.

```{r}
# get the class of a data.table and display it
class_dt = class(data.table(a = 1))
stri_flatten(str = class_dt, collapse = ", ")
```

### Detecting strings

Count the frequency of a pattern in a string with `stri_count`. Returns an inteegr.
Detect whether a pattern exists in a string with `stri_detect`. Returns a logical and can be used as a predicate.

Both are vectorised, i.e, automatically applied to a vector of arguments.

```{r count_matches_01}
# there should be 5 a-s here
# use the argument <fixed> to find a specific string
stri_count(str = "ababababa", fixed = "a")

# vectorise over the input string
# should return a vector of length 2, with integers 5 and 3
stri_count(str = c("ababbababa", "banana"), fixed = "a")

# vectorise over the pattern to count both a-s and b-s
stri_count(str = "ababababa", fixed = c("a", "b"))
```

Vectorising over both string and pattern works as expected.

```{r}
# vectorise over both string and pattern
# counts a-s in first input, and b-s in the second
stri_count(str = c("ababababa", "banana"),
           fixed = c("a", "b"))

# provide a longer pattern vector to search for both a-s
# and b-s in both inputs
stri_count(str = c("ababababa", "banana"),
           fixed = c("a", "b",
                     "b", "a"))
```

`stri_locate` locates the search pattern in a string, and returns the start and end as a two column matrix.

```{r}
# the behaviour of both stri_locate and stri_locate_all is
# to find the first match by default
stri_locate(str = "banana", fixed = "ana")
```

```{r}
# stri_detect detects a sequence in a string
stri_detect(str = "Bananageddon is coming!",
            fixed = "na")

# stri_detect is also vectorised and returns a two-element logical vector
stri_detect(str = "Bananageddon is coming!",
            fixed = c("na", "don"))

# use any or all to convert a multi-element logical to a single logical
# here we ask if either of the patterns is detected
any(stri_detect(str = "Bananageddon is coming!",
                fixed = c("na", "don")))
```

Detect whether a string starts or ends with a pattern. Also vectorised.
Both have a `negate` argument, which returns the negative, i.e., returns `FALSE` if the search pattern is detected.

```{r}
# taken straight from the examples, because they suffice
fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "pineapple")
# stri_detect looks at the first character
stri_startswith(fruit, fixed = "p")

# stri_ends looks at the last character
stri_endswith(fruit, fixed = "e")

# an example of negate = TRUE
stri_endswith(fruit, fixed = "e", negate = TRUE)
```

`stri_subset` [WHICH IS NOT RELATED TO `stri_sub`] helps with subsetting a character vector based on a `stri_detect` predicate.
In the example, all elements containing "banana" are subset.

`stri_which` does not exist so far as I can tell, but it's easily replicated.

```{r}
# should return a subset vector containing the first two elements
stri_subset(c("banana",
              "bananageddon is coming",
              "applegeddon is not real"),
            fixed = "banana")

# stri_which is easily replicated
which(stri_detect(c("banana",
                    "bananageddon is coming",
                    "applegeddon is not real"),
                  fixed = "banana"))
```

### Matching strings

`stri_match` returns all positive matches of the patttern in the string.
The return type is a `list`, with one element per search pattern.

A simple case is shown below where the search pattern is the phrase "banana".

```{r}
stri_match(str = c("banana",
                   "bananageddon",
                   "bananas are bad"),
           regex = "banana")
```

The search pattern can be extended to look for multiple subsets of the search pattern. Consider searching for dates and times.

Here, the search pattern is a `regex` pattern that looks for a set of four digits (`\\d{4}`) and a month name `(\\w+)` seperated by a hyphen. There's much more to be explored in dealing with dates and times in [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), another `tidyverse` package.

The return type is a list, each element is a character matrix where the first column is the string subset matching the full search pattern, and then as many columns as there are parts to the search pattern. The parts of interest in the search pattern are indicated by wrapping them in parentheses. For example, in the case below, wrapping `[-.]` in parentheses will turn it into a distinct part of the search pattern.

```{r}
# first with [-.] treated simply as a separator
stri_match(str = c("1970-somemonth-01",
                   "1990-anothermonth-01",
                   "2010-thismonth-01"),
           regex = "(\\d{4})[-.](\\w+)")

# then with [-.] actively searched for
stri_match(str = c("1970-somemonth-01",
                   "1990-anothermonth-01",
                   "2010-thismonth-01"),
          regex = "(\\d{4})([-.])(\\w+)")
```

Multiple possible matches are dealt with using `stri_match_all`. An example case is uncertainty in date-time in raw data, where the date has been entered as `1970-somemonth-01 or 1970/anothermonth/01`.

The return type is a list, with one element per input string. Each element is a character matrix, where each row is one possible match, and each column after the first (the full match) corresponds to the parts of the search pattern.

```{r}
# first with a single date entry
stri_match_all(str = c("1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01"),
              regex = "(\\d{4})[\\-\\/]([a-z]+)")

# then with multiple date entries
stri_match_all(str = c("1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01",
                         "1990-somemonth-01 or maybe 2001/anothermonth/01"),
               regex = "(\\d{4})[\\-\\/]([a-z]+)")
```

### Simpler pattern extraction

The full functionality of `stri_match_*` can be boiled down to the most common use case, extracting one or more full matches of the search pattern using `stri_extract` and `stri_extract_all` respectively.

`stri_extract` returns a character vector with the same length as the input string vector, while `stri_extract_all` returns a list, with a character vector whose elements are the matches.

```{r}
# extracting the first full match using stri_extract
stri_extract(str = c("1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01",
                       "1990-somemonth-01 or maybe 2001/anothermonth/01"),
            regex = "(\\d{4})[\\-\\/]([a-z]+)")

# extracting all full matches using stri_extract all
stri_extract_all(str = c("1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01",
                           "1990-somemonth-01 or maybe 2001/anothermonth/01"),
                regex = "(\\d{4})[\\-\\/]([a-z]+)")
```

### Breaking strings apart

`stri_split`, stri_sub,
In the above date-time example, when reading filenames from a path, or when working sequences separated by a known pattern generally, `stri_split` can help separate elements of interest.

The return type is a list similar to `stri_match`.

```{r}
# split on either a hyphen or a forward slash
stri_split(str = c("1970-somemonth-01",
                     "1990/anothermonth/01"),
          regex = "[\\-\\/]")
```

This can be useful in recovering simulation parameters from a filename, but may require some knowledge of `regex`.

```{r}
# assume a simulation output file
filename = "sim_param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext"

# not quite there
stri_split(filename, regex = "_")

# not really
stri_split(filename,
          regex = "sim_")

# getting there but still needs work
stri_split(filename,
          regex = "(sim_)|_*param\\d{1}_|(.ext)")
```

`stri_split_fixed` split the string into as many pieces as specified, and can be especially useful dealing with filepaths.

```{r}
# split on either a hyphen or a forward slash
stri_split_fixed(str = "dir_level_1/dir_level_2/file.ext",
                 pattern = "/",
                 n = 2)
```

### Replacing string elements

`stri_replace` is intended to replace the search pattern, and can be co-opted into the task of recovering simulation parameters or other data from regularly named files. `stri_replace_all` works the same way but replaces all matches of the search pattern.

```{r}
# replace all unwanted characters from this hypothetical filename with spaces
filename = "sim_param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext"
stri_replace_all(filename,
                 regex = "(sim_)|_*param\\d{1}_|(.ext)",
                 replacement = " ")
```

`stri_remove` is a wrapper around `stri_replace` where the replacement is set to `""`. This is not covered here.

Having replaced unwanted characters in the filename with spaces, `stri_trim` offers a way to remove leading and trailing whitespaces.

```{r}
# trim whitespaces from this filename after replacing unwanted text
filename = "sim_param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext"
filename_with_spaces = stri_replace_all(filename,
                                       regex = "(sim_)|_*param\\d{1}_|(.ext)",
                                       replacement = " ")
filename_without_spaces = stri_trim(filename_with_spaces)
filename_without_spaces

# the result can be split on whitespaces to return useful data
stri_split(filename_without_spaces, fixed = " ")
```

### Subsetting within strings

When strings are highly regular, useful data can be extracted from a string using `stri_sub`. In the date-time example, the year is always represented by the first four characters.

```{r}
# get the year as characters 1 - 4
stri_sub(str = c("1970-somemonth-01",
                 "1990-anothermonth-01",
                 "2010-thismonth-01"),
         from = 1, to = 4)
```

Similarly, it's possible to extract the last few characters using negative indices.

```{r}
# get the day as characters -2 to -1
stri_sub(str = c("1970-somemonth-01",
                   "1990-anothermonth-21",
                   "2010-thismonth-31"),
        from = -2, to = -1)
```

Finally, it's also possible to replace characters within a string based on the position. This requires using the assignment operator `<-`.

```{r}
# replace all days in these dates to 01
date_times = c("1970-somemonth-25",
               "1990-anothermonth-21",
               "2010-thismonth-31")

# a strictly necessary use of the assignment operator
stri_sub(date_times,
        from = -2, to = -1) <- "01"

date_times
```

### Padding and truncating strings

Strings included in filenames or plots are often of unequal lengths, especially when they represent numbers. `stri_pad` can pad strings with suitable characters to maintain equal length filenames, with which it is easier to work.

```{r}
# pad so all values have three digits
stri_pad(str = c("1", "10", "100"),
        width = 3,
        side = "left",
        pad = "0")
```

[`stringi`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/) offers a lot more flexibility and control.

## String interpolation with `sprintf`

The idea behind string interpolation is to procedurally generate new complex strings from pre-existing data.

```{r}
# print that each car name is a car model
cars = rownames(head(mtcars))
glue('The {cars} is a car model')
```

This creates and prints a vector of car names stating each is a car model.

The related `glue_data` is even more useful in printing from a dataframe.
In this example, it can quickly generate command line arguments or filenames.

```{r}
# use dataframes for now
parameter_combinations = data.frame(param1 = letters[1:5],
                                    param2 = 1:5)

# for command line arguments or to start multiple job scripts on the cluster
glue_data(parameter_combinations,
          'simulation-name {param1} {param2}')

# for filenames
glue_data(parameter_combinations,
          'sim_data_param1_{param1}_param2_{param2}.ext')
```

Finally, the convenient `glue_sql` and `glue_data_sql` are used to safely write SQL queries where variables from data are appropriately quoted. This is not covered here, but it is good to know it exists.

`glue` has some more functions --- `glue_safe`, `glue_collapse`, and `glue_col`, but these are infrequently used. Their functionality can be found on the `glue` github page.
