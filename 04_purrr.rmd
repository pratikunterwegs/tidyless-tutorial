# Iteration and functional programming with `purrr`

```{r}
# load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```

## Iteration with `map` and variants

Iteration in base `R` is commonly done with `for` and `while` loops.
There is no readymade alternative to `while` loops in the tidyverse.

However, the functionality of `for` loops is spread over the `map` family of functions.

`map` and relatives are _functionals_, functions which accept other functions as arguments.

### `map` basic use

Consider a case in which multiple files must be read in.

```{r}
files_to_read = list.files("")
```
